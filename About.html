<pre>
The spreading of fake accounts/ botsâ€Ÿ is continuously evolving, and feature based machine-learning detection systems employing
 highly predictive behaviors provide unique opportunities to develop an understanding of how to discriminate between bots and humans, 
i.e. between real vs. fake accounts on social media. The popularity of twitter has fostered the emergence of a new spam marketplace.
 The services that this market provides include: the sale of fraudulent accounts, , as well as a cadre of spammers who execute large 
scale spam campaigns. In addition, twitter users have started to buy fake followers of their accounts . different machine learning 
algorithms have been developed to detect fake followers in Twitter. A study verified 13000 purchased fake followers and 5386 genuine 
followers. A number of characteristics that distinguish fake and genuine followers were also identified. And then these characteristics 
were used as attributes to machine learning algorithms to classify users as fake or genuine. high detection accuracy was achieved using
 some machine learning algorithms.
